Story

I have known about Sarek National Park for many years, but I never had the time to go in the summer. Following my trip to the area the year before in 2023 to hike the northern part of the Kungsleden trail, I came back in 2023 to trek in "the Sarek."

Sarek National Park is not for the weak; you must be fully prepared to hike off-trail in bad weather conditions. The area receives the most rain in all of Sweden, and the weather turns rough quickly. I knew my gear was rain proof due to my 2023 trip, and I am comfortable in navigation using a map and compass, and navigating rough terrain. There are several river crossings which can become treacherous quickly especially if alone. I had several route options, and extra food provisions. I also carry a garmin in-reach. Help is hours away.
