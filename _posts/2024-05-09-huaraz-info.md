Tropical glaciers such as the 722 which surround Huaraz are melting at a much faster rate than those in other non-equatorial alpine areas. 70% of the world’s tropical glaciers lie in the region. The region depends on freshwater from these glaciers, and because they are melting, the lakes that the glacier water flows into are overflowing as well. In particular, the city of Huaraz is at high risk for a “glacial lake outburst flood” or what scientists have so eloquently dubbed “deadly flood doomsday timebomb event” This is due to Lake Palcacocha which lies some 4,500 meters above the city with in its direct flood-line path. In 1941, an avalanche fell into the lake causing a GLOF event. The flood reached the city within fifteen minutes and killed 1,800 inhabitants. After this, the city installed certain measures to combat flood risk, but there was little knowledge of the effects that climate change would have on the region, so today these measures are not enough. Ten black pipes were installed to help mitigate water flow, but only two are functioning today. There are also three guards which live in a small hut with no electricity or running water near the lake. Every two hours, one of the guards measures the water level and reports this to city officials via satellite phone. The city lacks funding to mitigate the issue. Most of the population does not know of the flood risk, but those that do are taking action. One such person is Saul Luciano Lliuya, a farmer and mountain guide who sued German energy company RWE for “knowingly contributing to climate change by emitting greenhouse gasses.” Lliuya, backed by the NGO Germanwatch, demands payment of $20,000 to install urgent safety measures for the prevention of flooding.
