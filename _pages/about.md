I graduated from the [University of Pittsburgh][pitt] with a degree in applied math, and am currently at the [University of British Columbia][ubc]. Currently, I am applying to jobs in data-oriented jobs to gain industry experience. 

My long-term ten year plan is to pursue a PhD to become a climate scientist with the goal of providing information to policy makers to incite actionable change.

In this realm, I have many, many interests that only seem to be growing. In the past, I was heavily involved in research centered around bioengineering, chemical engineering, and mathematical biology. I became interested in climate problems from a [trip](https://akb75.github.io/2022/08/02/huaraz-info.html) to the Cordillera Blanca range in Huaraz, Peru.

My ultimate goal is to increase our understanding of the complex climate system through scientific computing and advanced numerical modeling. I enjoy working on problems that address humanitarian issues. I feel it is best to detail my interests in terms of questions that peak my curiosity. I am also open to other research topics as well.

- How can we use numerical modeling to optimally allocate water resources under environmental, social, and economic constraints?
  The term "water resources" is intentionally vague and includes groundwater, streamflow predictions, glacial water loss, precipitation prediction, amongst other forms of freshwater.

  Subquestions to this broad topic would be:

  - How can we predict future glacial water loss?
  - How can computational fluid dynamics (CFD) be used to model the behavior and distribution of microplastics?

- What are the long term effects on the Atlantic Meriodonal Circulation (AMOC) due to Arctic ice melt?

- How can we better model extreme weather events such as floods and droughts?

In my free time, I enjoy backpacking to remote destinations around the world. I am also a triathlete, climber, and avid reader.
