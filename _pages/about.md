I graduated from the [University of Pittsburgh][pitt] with a degree in applied math, and am currently at the [University of British Columbia][ubc].
My long-term plan is to become a climate scientist to provide information to policy makers to promote actionable change.

In this realm, I have many, many interests that only seem to be growing. In the past, I was heavily involved in research centered around bioengineering, chemical engineering, and mathematical biology. I became interested in climate problems from a [trip](https://akb75.github.io/2022/08/02/huaraz-info.html) to the Cordillera Blanca range in Huaraz, Peru.

My ultimate goal is to increase our understanding of the complex climate system through scientific computing and advanced numerical modeling. I enjoy working on problems that address humanitarian issues. 

- How can we use numerical modeling to optimally allocate water resources under environmental, social, and economic constraints?
  The term "water resources" is intentionally vague and includes groundwater, streamflow predictions, glacial water loss, precipitation prediction, amongst other forms of freshwater.

  Subquestions to this broad topic would be:

  - How can we predict future glacial water loss?
  - How can computational fluid dynamics (CFD) be used to model the behavior and distribution of microplastics?

- What are the long term effects on the Atlantic Meriodonal Circulation (AMOC) due to Arctic ice melt?

- How can we better model extreme weather events such as floods and droughts?

In my free time, I enjoy hiking in remote destinations around the world. I am also a triathlete, climber, and avid reader.
