Hi there! üòÉ

My name is Ali and I'm a soon-to-be-graduating master's student at [Mila][Mila] & the [University of Montr√©al][UdeM], supervised by [Prof. Liam Paull][lp] at the [Montreal Robotics and Embodied AI Lab][mlab]. I'm quite passionate about AI and robotics research, and engaged in the quest to understand and simulate intelligence. The [ConceptFusion][cf_paper] and [ConceptGraphs][cg_paper] papers which I worked on during my masters are small steps towards this goal.

**I am currently actively seeking out work opportunities for both full-time roles and internships. I'm open to relocation and non-robotics roles, what matters to me is working on important problems! You can take a look at my resume [here][cv]. If you'd like to get in touch, please don't hesitate to email me at alihusein.kuwajerwala@x, x=umontreal.ca, or on Twitter/LinkedIn!**

I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in applied math, and am currently at the University of British Columbia. My intention is to pursue a PhD to become a climate scientist with the goal of providing information to policy makers to incite actionable change. I have many, many interests that only seem to be growing. My ultimate goal is to increase our understanding of the climate system through scientific computing. Questions that peak my curioisty include: 
 I am most interested in studying climate tipping points related to Arctic ice melt (long term effects on the Southern Ocean from ice melt), water scarcity issues (groundwater scarcity, water loss from glaciers, streamflow predictions, global modeling of water resources, microplastics in waste-water), modeling extreme weather events (floods, droughts)

I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in May 2023 with a degree in applied math and related coursework in computer science. My intention is to pursue a masters degree in mathematics to transition into the field of climate dynamics. In this realm, I am interested in modeling complex mathematical problems related atmospheric science, hydrology, or oceanography. In particular, my interests are broad and stem across researching Arctic-ocean ice interactions, climate tipping points, or water scarcity issues. I hope to hone in on a specific problem during my masters, and my ultimate goal is to pursue a PhD to become a climate scientist. 


Previously, I interned at the [Alexa AI][aai] team at [Amazon][amzn], where I worked on using large language models for querying databases. In between my undergrad and master's I was a student researcher at the [Robot, Vision and Learning Lab][RVL] at the [University of Toronto][uoft] supervised by [Prof. Florian Shkurti][flo] where I worked on [visual navigation for mobile robots][eq]. I've also worked in software engineering roles at [Epson][epsn] and [Liquid Analytics][la].

My undergrad was at the [Univeristy of Toronto][uoft] where I studied CS & Math, and also worked as a Teaching Assistant. During my time there I was co-founder of the [UTM Robotics Club][utmr], and a recipient of the [NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award][na].

I've also worked on a couple of fun coding projects which you can look at via my [github profile][gh].

When I'm not staring at a screen all day, you can find me training jiu-jitsu, listening to audiobooks and podcasts, doodling, and/or chatting with wonderful people on my [podcast][pd]. ‚úåÔ∏è
