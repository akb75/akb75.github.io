<!-- prettier-ignore -->
I graduated from the [University of Pittsburgh][pitt] with a degree in applied mathematics in 2023. I am currently obtaining my Bachelor of Science in Nursing at the Idaho State University. Upon graduating, my goal is to obtain a new graduate nurse position at an Intensive Care Unit as an ICU nurse. My estimated graduation date is May 2027. I will take the NCLEX at the end of May 2027. 

In my free time, I enjoy hiking in remote destinations around the world. I am also a triathlete, climber, and avid reader. I enjoy cooking and baking, and might even bring baked goods for my coworkers from time to time (if allowed)!

Why nursing? 
During my undergraduate math degree, I was heavily involved in research in bioengineering and chemical engineering. Although this work was not directly patient-facing, my past research project "Esophagel" is currently used on patients with esophagus cancer at UPMC by Dr. Blair Jobe. While I value the impact of research, I found myself missing the immediacy of patient care, and the ability to make a difference in patients' lives on a daily basis. This motivated my transition into nursing. 

Why ICU? 
As a systems thinker, I am drawn to complex physiology and want to understand "why" things happen. Perhaps this is a natural curiosity, or perhaps this is a result of my mathematical training. In the ICU, patient care requires continous monitoring of data with rapidly evolving clinical status. I am motivated by this level of complexity and responsibility. Additionally, in 2025, I was a mountain mentor with the British Columbia Mountaineering Club, a role that strengthened my leadership capabilities, teamwork, and support my mentees in high-risk alpine environments. 

I anticipate that for the next 3-5 years, I will be working as an intensive care nurse and deepening my understanding of critical illness.
