I graduated from the [University of Pittsburgh][pitt] with a degree in applied math, and am currently at the [University of British Columbia][ubc]. My intention is to pursue a PhD to become a climate scientist with the goal of providing information to policy makers to incite actionable change.

I have many, many interests that only seem to be growing. In the past, I was heavily involved in research centered around bioengineering, chemical engineering, and mathematical biology. I became interested in climate problems from a trip to the Cordillera Blanca range in Huaraz, Peru. Read here!

My ultimate goal is to increase our understanding of the climate system through scientific computing. I enjoy working on interesting, complex problems. I feel it is best to detail my interests in terms of questions that peak my curiosity.

1. How can we use AI and coupled human-environmental data to optimally allocate water resources under environmental, social, and economic constraints?
   The term "water resources" is intentionally vague and includes groundwater, streamflow predictions, glacial water loss, precipitation prediction, amongst other forms of freshwater.

- How can we predict future glacial water loss?

2. What are the long term effects on the Atlantic Meriodonal Circulation (AMOC) due to Arctic ice melt?

3. How can we better model extreme weather events such as floods and droughts? Uncertainty quantification

4. Sustainable agriculture sentinel data

5. Microplastics in waste-water

In my free time, I enjoy backpacking to remote destinations around the world. I am also a duathlete (trying to get back into tri), climber, and avid reader.

Currently, I am working on grad-school apps, building this website, and learning lead-climbing.
