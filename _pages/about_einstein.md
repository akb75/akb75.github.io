This is my old bio: 

I graduated from the [University of Pittsburgh][pitt] with a degree in applied math, and am currently at the [University of British Columbia][ubc].
My long-term plan is to become a climate scientist to provide information to policy makers to promote actionable change. 

In this realm, I have many, many interests that only seem to be growing. In the past, I was heavily involved in research centered around bioengineering, chemical engineering, and mathematical biology. I became interested in climate problems from a [trip](https://akb75.github.io/2022/08/02/huaraz-info.html) to the Cordillera Blanca range in Huaraz, Peru in May 2022.

My ultimate goal is to increase our understanding of the complex climate system through scientific computing and advanced numerical modeling. I enjoy working on problems that address humanitarian issues. 

  Subquestions to this broad topic would be:
  - How can we use numerical modeling to optimally allocate water resources under environmental, social, and economic constraints?
  - How can we predict future glacial water loss?
  - How can computational fluid dynamics (CFD) be used to model the behavior and distribution of microplastics?
- What are the long term effects on the Atlantic Meriodonal Circulation (AMOC) due to Arctic ice melt?
- How can we better model extreme weather events such as floods and droughts? 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
